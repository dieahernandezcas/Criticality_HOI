    "# Simulating and Storing Brain Network Activity for Multiple \"Patients\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script leverages the `neurolib` library to simulate brain activity using the **Wilson-Cowan (WC) model** across a whole-brain network. The primary goal is to generate simulated neural signals for a cohort of 200 \"patients,\" each assigned to one of several predefined neurological conditions (e.g., healthy, coma, brain death). The raw and binarized (thresholded) activity for each simulated patient is then saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The script performs the following main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Configuration**: Sets up simulation parameters like duration and binarization threshold.\n",
    "2.  **Condition Definition**: Defines a set of distinct neurological \"conditions,\" each with its own specific set of Wilson-Cowan model parameters. These parameters are chosen to approximate the neurobiological characteristics of each state.\n",
    "3.  **Data Directory Setup**: Ensures a directory exists to store the output data.\n",
    "4.  **HCP Dataset Loading**: Loads structural connectivity (`Cmat`) and distance (`Dmat`) matrices from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset, which are crucial for simulating a whole-brain network.\n",
    "5.  **Simulation Loop**: Iterates through each defined condition, running multiple simulations per condition to reach the target of 200 patients.\n",
    "6.  **Signal Processing**: For each simulation, it extracts the excitatory neural activity and binarizes it based on a statistical threshold.\n",
    "7.  **Data Saving**: Saves both the raw and binarized simulated signals for each patient into separate `.pkl` (pickle) files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components and Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. General Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "* `duration`: Sets the total simulation time in milliseconds (e.g., 20,000 ms or 20 seconds).\n",
    "* `threshold_multiplier`: Used to calculate a binarization threshold for activity. Signals exceeding `mean + threshold_multiplier * std` are considered \"active\" (1), otherwise \"inactive\" (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `subject_conditions` Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core of simulating different patient types. It's a dictionary where each key represents a neurological condition (e.g., `\"Healthy_Critical\"`, `\"Coma\"`), and its value is another dictionary containing specific **Wilson-Cowan model parameters** for that condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parameter Variation**: Parameters like `exc_ext` (external excitatory input), `K_gl` (global coupling), `sigma_ou` (noise level), `tau_exc`/`tau_inh` (time constants), and `a_exc`/`a_inh` / `c_exc`/`c_inh` (sigmoid gains and intrinsic weights) are carefully tuned for each condition to mimic different brain states.\n",
    "* **Filename Friendly Names**: The keys are named using underscores (e.g., `Healthy_Critical`, `Brain_Death`) to be suitable for use in filenames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Storage (`pathlib` and `pickle`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`pathlib.Path`**: Used for robust and cross-platform handling of file paths, making it easy to create directories and construct filenames.\n",
    "* **`data_dir = Path(\"../data\")`**: Defines the output directory as `../data` (one level up from the script's location). The `.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` ensures the directory exists, creating parent directories if necessary.\n",
    "* **`pickle`**: The `pickle` module is used to serialize (save) Python objects (like NumPy arrays representing the simulated signals) into `.pkl` binary files. This is efficient for storing numerical data.\n",
    "* **Filename Convention**: Each patient's data is saved in two files following the convention: `patient_XXX_TYPE_raw.pkl` and `patient_XXX_TYPE_binarized.pkl`, where `XXX` is a zero-padded patient ID (e.g., `001`) and `TYPE` is the condition key (e.g., `healthy_critical`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Simulation Loop and Patient Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`num_patients = 200`**: Sets the total number of patients to simulate.\n",
    "* **Equal Distribution**: The script calculates `patients_per_condition` to distribute the total patients as equally as possible among the defined conditions. It also handles any remainder patients by assigning them to the first conditions in the dictionary.\n",
    "* **Model Instantiation**: For each simulation, a new `wc.WCModel` is created, crucially initialized with the `Cmat` and `Dmat` to enable whole-brain network dynamics.\n",
    "* **Parameter Assignment**: The condition-specific parameters are assigned to `model.params` before running each simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Signal Binarization\n",
    "\n",
    "* After each simulation, the raw excitatory activity (`exc_raw`) is binarized channel by channel.\n",
    "* The threshold for binarization is calculated dynamically for **each channel** as `mean_activity_per_channel + threshold_multiplier * std_activity_per_channel`. This adapts to the varying activity levels across different brain regions and conditions.\n",
    "* A check `if std_i == 0:` is included to prevent division by zero errors if a channel has no variance (e.g., completely flat activity in \"Brain Death\").\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This script provides a powerful framework for generating synthetic neuroimaging data that can be used for further analysis, such as studying avalanche dynamics, functional connectivity, or training machine learning models on different neurological states."
